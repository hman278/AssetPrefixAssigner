First close the editor
Clone the repository to your project's plugin folder or download it from the marketplace ( in some cases you may need to regenerate your vs project )
Open the editor, go to Editor->Plugins, find the plugin, enable it
If you are using Unreal 5, you will see a new button appear under Window named "AssetPrefixAssigner", click that for the plugin to start doing its work
On Unreal 4 there will be a new button added in the toolbar, simply click it and the plugin will start doing its work

You can at any time modify how the plugin names your assets. Simply go to the Resources folder of the plugin,
and open either AssetProperties.json or BlueprintAssetProperties.json. You will see that for every asset type
there are two fields, class and prefix. Depending on your teams naming conventions, you can just change
the prefix fields to your preferred prefixes for any class you'd like, or add new fields.

Any asset that is derived from UBlueprint should be defined in BlueprintAssetProperties.json, for any other type it should be AssetProperties.json

IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You must ensure that your Content folder's contents are all NOT read-only, otherwise, the plugin will not function properly.
If you use version control software like Perforce, make sure that all the assets that you want to be renamed are checked out, otherwise, the plugin may not work.
